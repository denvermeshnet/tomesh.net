{:#work-with-us}

### Collaborate on our Kanban Board

Toronto Mesh uses a [Kanban (看板)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) to keep track of ideas and progress. The software we use is the self-hosted open-source [Wekan](https://github.com/wekan/wekan). Create an account on [wekan.tomesh.net](https://wekan.tomesh.net), and then ask on {% include icon-matrix.html %} or email {% if site.email %}{% include icon-email.html %}{% endif %} for an invite to our board.

#### Propose an Idea

- Create a new card in the **Ideas** column by adding a short title
- Include details in the description and add appropriate labels for easy filtering

#### Participate in the Discussion

- You can add a comment to any card
- Discuss a card on {% include icon-matrix.html %}

#### Work on a Card

- Find a card you would like to take ownership and add yourself as a member to that card
- Move the card to the **Discuss** or **In Progress** column, then **Done** when completed

### Contribute to our Git Repositories

We use git, a version control tool, and GitHub to work on this [website](https://github.com/tomeshnet/tomesh.net), our [Raspberry Pi prototype](https://github.com/tomeshnet/prototype-cjdns-pi2), our [educational materials on network literacy](https://github.com/tomeshnet/tomesh.101), and keep record of [important documents](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents) like our meeting notes. Please see our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomeshnet/).

## Funding the Project

Toronto Mesh consists of a collective of people and does not currently hold legal status as an organization, nor do we have a bank account. Workshops, conferences, and deployments are generally paid out-of-pocket by the people organizing that particular initiative. You may find a donation jar at some events to help cover costs.

Grant applications are applied for in partnership with non-profit organizations, and each application is agreed upon using [our general method of establishing consensus](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/governance/coordination-structure.md#decision-making), either at meetings or virtually on [#funding:tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#funding:tomesh.net). We keep [a listing of all grants and sources of institutional funding](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/tree/master/governance/funding.md) that involve Toronto Mesh as a partner.

If you would like to contribute to the Toronto Mesh project as an organization, or have any questions regarding our finances, please email [funding@tomesh.net](mailto:funding@tomesh.net) or join [#funding:tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#funding:tomesh.net).
